# Personal Trainer App

## Description
This project was created by Marcus Moe as a part of the Front End Development course.
The backend code of this project is a REST API, ran by my teacher. Front-end was the main focus of the application and therefore I did not work on the backend. The application's purpose is to provide CRUD functionality regarding "customers" and training sessions.

I utilized React for the creation of this application. 

A live version of the application can be found [here](https://marcuspersonaltrainer.herokuapp.com/).
